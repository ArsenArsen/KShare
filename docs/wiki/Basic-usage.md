# Basic usage
When you start the app (with no arguments, discussed later) a window is popped up, and a tray icon is made.

## The window

The main window is a log window with a settings button.

The menu bar has a `File` menu. It has two options, `Quit`, which exits ~~no need to press it :^)~~, and `About`, which contains licensing information:

There is a second menu, namely `Screenshot`. It has two options, area, and fullscreen capture. See below.  

The third, `Utility`, menu has the color picker in it.

The fourth and final menu, `Recording`, has a start and stop recording button.

## The tray

The tray consists of a small, but nice, icon made by @BriannaFoxwell. Upon right clicking it you get the context menu shown above. The menu is rather simple, containing basic controls, and screenshotting options.  
These options will be explained below.

## Screenshotting options
### Area capture
Area capture takes a snapshot of the screen, and shows you a fullscreen editor for you to select a region in. This editor is explained in a section below.

### Fullscreen capture
Fullscreen capture takes a snapshot of the entire screen and skips the editor part. Straight to the destination (explained later as well).

### Active window capture
Takes the active window and uploads it straight to your destination of choice

## Crop Editor
Crop Editor is a window you can use to select the area of the screen to upload. It consists of a grey overlay and a re-sizable rectangle. The rectangle is resized by holding the mouse buttons. When you let go of the button, a new selection will start replacing the old one. On the first press the same thing happens.
Press `Escape` to cancel, and `Return`, or `Enter` to submit.  
Oh. And you can draw with the bar that appears on the top.
